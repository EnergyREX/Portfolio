Who am I?

I'm a guy who is still learning to develop the ""essentials"". I'm from Spain, Almer√≠a. I'm 19 years old. I was interested in AI since I was 15, and in programming since I was 17. I'm interested on social media too.

What do I want to do with this CV page?

-I want to demonstrate to recruiters what I can do right now, showing my personal projects and other projects if possible where I participated, what I've made with the technologies what I've learnt. The projects, obviously, will be shown there and in GitHub.

-Also, I'd like to have a record of what I've learnt while the time passes so I can see how was my progress, and maybe help someone, and the problems what I had with something and how I solved it.
