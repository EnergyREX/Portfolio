Who am I?

I'm a guy who is still learning to develop on the Fullstack environment, but I want to specialize on FrontEnd.

What do I want to do with this CV page?

- I want to demonstrate to recruiters what I can do right now, showing my personal projects and other projects if possible where I participated, what I've made with the technologies what I've learnt. The projects, obviously, will be shown there and in GitHub.

- Also, I'd like to have a record of what I've learnt while the time passes so I can see how was my progress, and maybe help someone, and the problems what I had with something and how I solved it.

The TO-DO list:What I have to do:

- Make the main Style of website. OK, 70%
- A separate "works/projects" pages for each project.

- Add a dark / light mode toggler. #DarkForEver. Not started, just made dark mode.
- Give & add animations, and give a better presentation of me. Just 20%. 
- "Condensed" site, with the most less pages, only separated for projects if needed.
