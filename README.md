## Why Next.js?

There are some main reasons. 

- 1st, It's a React.js framework with all things I would need to make a project.
- 2nd, Since It's a framework, it includes many optimizations who I could not make it with React.

In summary, I will use Next to build this portfolio because of its advantages and because is a nice opportunity to learn this framework
Also, I know there are other very good options to make projects like this, such as Astro.build, but this time I will use Next.
