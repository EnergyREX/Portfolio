# Who am I?

I'm a guy who is still learning to develop on the Fullstack environment, but I want to specialize on FrontEnd.

In the future probably, I use other techs as like Astro to give better performance on the website.

The portfolio needs still needs work, for example on the side of the functions, like making it to be en English or Spanish (If it can auto-detect, better) or changing theme.

Also, needs to end the other "new sections" of "work" and "contact". Maybe on the future I build a blog section on the website.

I have some projects considered, like:

- A "Big" Minecraft Mod for a Minecraft Server, with continous development.
- Other websites / projects I've done
