Open **Powershell** or your terminal.

Clone the repo with ``git clone https://github.com/energyrex/portfolio`` (You should have installed Git before.)

Go to the directory of the portfolio, in this case you should use ``cd portfolio``

Run `` npm run dev `` in terminal. You should check if you are in the correspondant directory. You should have Node and Npm installed.

Go to `` localhost:3000 ``

## Why Next.js?

There are some main reasons. 

- 1st, It's a React.js framework with all things I would need to make a project.
- 2nd, Since It's a framework, it includes many optimizations who I could not make it with React.

In summary, I will use Next to build this portfolio because of its advantages and because is a nice opportunity to learn this framework
Also, I know there are other very good options to make projects like this, such as Astro.build, but this time I will use Next.
